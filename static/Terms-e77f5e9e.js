In some cases, you may be required to do so in order to download, access or play a Game. You may also use an account or log-in from a social network or other platform that our Games or other Services interact with. If you do create an account with GU or you use our Games or other Services from a social network or platform using your account and log-in details from there, you agree that you must take all steps necessary to protect your log-in details and keep them confidential. You agree that you may not give your log-in details to anyone else and that you may not allow anyone else to use your log-in details or your account. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> You agree that we are entitled to assume that anyone logging into your account using your log-in details is either you or someone logging in with your explicit permission. If you do not keep your log-in details secret, or if you share your log-in details or account with someone else, you accept full responsibility for the consequences of this (including any unauthorized purchases). In such cases, you agree to fully compensate us for any losses or harm that may result. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> You agree that GU is not responsible for any loss that you suffer as a result of an unauthorized person or computer accessing your account or using our Services.

In such event, you may no longer be able to access or use any Coins or Boosters (as defined below) associated with that account. Further, you will not be offered a refund. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> Any account you have created with GU is personal and you are not entitled to transfer it to anyone. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> You accept that if you delete an account that you have created with GU, or if we delete such account in accordance with these Terms, you will lose access to any data previously associated with your account including your progress through the Games, the level or score you have reached in the Games, any team you have connected with or created, any Coins or Boosters you have acquired and any communications made using our Services. </p><h3 data-v-a13833c7>4 Coins and Boosters</h3><p data-v-a13833c7> Our Games may include virtual coins (in the following referred to as “Coins&quot;) and resources that helps you advance in the Games (in the following referred to as “Boosters”). Coins and Booster can be earned as part of the Game. Coins and Boosters can also be purchased in the Games using either coins or using real money. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> You understand and accept that once you have purchased Coins and Boosters, they have no monetary value and do not represent any stored value and can not be exchanged for real money. You accept that Coins and Boosters may not be transferred to anyone else and you agree that you will not transfer or attempt to transfer any Coins or Boosters. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> You also agree that although we use terms like “purchase”, you do not purchase a good; rather you purchase a license, which is personal, non-exclusive, limited and revocable. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> You accept that all sales by us to you of Coins or Boosters are final and that we will not grant you refunds on any transaction once it has been completed. If you reside in the European Union you are in certain cases entitled to withdraw from distance purchases pursuant to European Union law or national law; However, when you purchase a license to use Coins or Boosters from us, you acknowledge that they are a digital service which is to be considered consumed immediately and that therefore – to the furthest degree permitted by law - your right of withdrawal has ceased at this point. A purchase of Coins or Boosters is considered completed at the time the Coins or Boosters have successfully been credited to your account. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> If you chose not to connect your game play to Facebook, we may not be able to restore any Coins or other data associated with your Game to a different device if you lose your first device or if it is damaged. Because of this, any risk of loss of Coins or Boosters, which you have purchased, is transferred to you upon completion of the purchase. Any risk of loss of Coins or Boosters that you receive from us without making a purchase is transferred to you at the time the Coin or Booster is credited to your account. Other data related to your Games including your progress through Games, or the level or score you have reached in Games is transferred to you immediately at the time such data is generated. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> Unless you have connected your Game to an account on Facebook it is not synced between different devices and we may not have a backup of your Game. This means that any risk of loss of this data relating to Coins or Boosters is transferred to you upon completion of the purchase and - in cases where the Coin or Booster is not purchased - at the time the Coin or Booster is credited or awarded to you. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> The app store or social network you use when purchasing Games or making in-app purchases will provide you with an invoice. These invoices will be in electronic format only. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> GU reserves the right to change or remove any Coins or Boosters without any liability to you. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> At any time, GU may change the pricing for Coins and Boosters, both before and after you have downloaded a Game. We may also expand or limit the total amount of Boosters or Coins that can be purchased at once or held in your account. You are obliged not to purchase Coins or Boosters from any source which is not GU or authorized by GU. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> Please notice that different platforms and social networks have different terms and conditions that apply to app purchases and in-app purchases on those networks and platforms. Consequently, they treat the purchase of Coins and Boosters differently. You should check with your platform or social network before making a purchase. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> Unless it says otherwise, content available for purchase in any in-game store has the same age rating as the Game. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> If we suspend or terminate your account, you may lose any Coins and Boosters that you have and GU will not make any refunds or otherwise compensate you for this loss. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> The charge for Coins, Boosters or other virtual goods, Games or other items you can purchase will be as stated in the Game, app store or social network where you make the purchase, except in the case of obvious error. The charge is inclusive of all sales taxes and other charges. Depending on which app store, social network, bank, credit card or payment provider you use, additional charges may be issued; GU has no control over this and accept no liability in relation to it. If you are unsure whether you will be subject to such additional charges then you should check with the app store, social network, bank, credit card or payment provider before making a purchase. The app store, social network, bank, credit card or payment provider may have their own terms and conditions and you should make sure that you are in agreement with these before making any payments. </p><h3 data-v-a13833c7>5 User conduct and content</h3><p data-v-a13833c7> When playing our Games, you must comply with all applicable laws in the location that you access our Games or other Services from.

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, has exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of the Terms, including any claim that all or any part of the Terms or the Privacy Policy is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator is empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator&#39;s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and, to the extent applicable, the Consumer Minimum Standards, including the then-current limit on arbitration filing fees. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost. You understand that without this mandatory provision, you would have had the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. You also understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> If you are a resident of the United States of America, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States of America convenient for you. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> Notwithstanding the parties&#39; decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, or trade secret misappropriation. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court&#39;s jurisdiction. For the avoidance of doubt, claims related to the license granted to you for Games and other Services, are not exempt from the arbitration clause. </p><h3 data-v-a13833c7>20 Binding class action waiver for residents in the United States of America</h3><p data-v-a13833c7> If you are a resident of the United States of America, you agree that any arbitration must be conducted in your individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and you expressly waive your right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> Thus, we agree that each of us may only bring claims against the other party arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Privacy Policy only in your individual capacity or in our individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class action member in any purported class or representative proceeding. </p><p data-v-a13833c7> If any court or arbitrator should determine that the class action waiver in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason, or if it should determine that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision above will be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties will be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes. </p><h3 data-v-a13833c7>21 Opt-out</h3><p data-v-a13833c7> You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in sections 19 and 20. above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: YAU LEE CENTER, KWUN TONG, KL.
